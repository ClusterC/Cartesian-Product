# Cartesian-Product
The algorithm is consistent with the “Cartesian Product”.
Cartesian comes from the name of the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes, who played a significant role in developing the Cartesian coordinate system that uses the x and y axes to determine positions in a plane.
In addition, in mathematics there is the concept of the "Cartesian product," which refers to pairing members of two sets together to form a set of all possible pairs. For example:
- If set A = {0, 1}, then the Cartesian product A × A yields {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}.
- If set A = {0, 1, 2}, then the Cartesian product A × A yields {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)}.
